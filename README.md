# yamt-lite
Yet another (re)mount tool kernel plugin for PS Vita/PS TV

Requires enso, compatible ONLY with firmware 3.60 and 3.65.

This version doesn't rely on a config file, it disables itself if there's nothing in the cartridge slot, and just mounts SD2Vita as ux0 and the Sony memory card or internal storage (of a Vita 2000/IMCUnlocked 1000) as uma0.
